Using containers with 10000 elements.
All times include time needed to point the iterator to the correct element.

Time to remove an element from the front of the container:
Vector: 5e-06 seconds
List: 2e-06 seconds
List is faster, by 3e-06seconds.

Time to remove an element from the back of the container:
Vector: 0 seconds
List: 0 seconds
List is faster, by 0seconds.

Time to remove an element from the center of the container:
Vector: 2e-06 seconds
List: 4.1e-05 seconds
Vector is faster, by 3.9e-05seconds.

Time to remove an element from the front quarter of the container:
Vector: 3e-06 seconds
List: 2.3e-05 seconds
Vector is faster, by 2e-05seconds.

Time to remove an element from the back quarter of the container:
Vector: 1e-06 seconds
List: 2.2e-05 seconds
Vector is faster, by 2.1e-05seconds.
